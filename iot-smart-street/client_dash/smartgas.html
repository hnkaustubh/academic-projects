		<p>Technological solutions called &#34smart wells&#34 and &#34smart fields&#34 have been applied in petroleum industry for nearly two decades. They aim to improve the knowledge of petroleum production processes, and thereby improve the efficiency of operations. Researchers and companies in pursuit of their goals tend to use one-sided implications and numerous synonyms when describing the substance of the term, which leads to an occasional confusion. In order to study the concept of smart field from a general perspective, a literature review has been conducted, and main characteristic attributes of such solutions have been revealed. Selected marketed products offered by engineering companies have been analyzed as examples of the technology implementation. A definition has been proposed along with its practical implications. Additionally, an attempt has been made to place these solutions in a broad scientific context of intelligence and sustainability in contemporary business processes.</p>
		<p>The adoption of smart gas meters in Europe is picking up speed. This year alone, the installed base of remotely read gas meters for consumers nearly doubled to 17.3 million units in EU28+2. The growth is mainly driven by nationwide rollouts in France, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK.

A variety of communication technologies are in use for the rollouts, including fixed RF networks, mobile networks and local interfaces to master electricity meters.

As next generation IoT-optimized 4G/5G mobile technologies become more widely available, it is expected that there will be a shift from legacy RF platforms to emerging standards like NB-IoT.

Italy was the first European country where smart gas meter installations began on a large scale. The national Regulatory Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water has set a target that 60% of residential gas meters and 100% of industrial gas meters should be smart by 2018 and full coverage by 2020.

The policy is based on a cost benefit analysis which concluded that there would be an economic benefit for gas DSOs with 50,000 customers or more to introduce smart meters for a total of 22 million customers. As a result, deployments started to take off in Italy during 2014.</p>

	<p>U.S. LIQUEFIED NATURAL gas exports are reshaping the global energy landscape. As U.S. LNG cargoes make their way to Europe, South America, the Middle East and East Asia, once hard and fast assumptions about the future trade of LNG have been turned upside down. As a result, we are only just beginning to understand the benefits afforded by America's shale revolution and our emergence as the world's largest natural gas producer.

Not so long ago, the U.S. was expected to rival Japan as the world's largest importer of LNG. Russia, Iran and Qatar seemed so dominant in the international natural gas marketplace, it was feared they might form an LNG cartel along the lines of OPEC. Those fears have been put soundly to bed by the amazing shale revolution.

Instead of being a major LNG importer, the U.S. is on track to become one of the world's largest exporters. Once constrained, the global LNG marketplace is now booming. Although only one U.S. LNG export terminal is currently in operation – several more are currently under construction – Citigroup believes the U.S. Gulf Coast could soon become a major, if not the world's leading, LNG-trading hub. This development is tremendously important for the U.S. economy and our commitment to global trade as well as the energy security of our allies.</p>

	<p>Upstream companies are increasingly acknowledging digitization as an important enabler of cost savings and profitability, and are therefore gravitating toward tools such as smart pumps according to a Frost & Sullivan report. Among the many new-generation pumps in the market, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-enabled and energy-efficient pumps with demonstrable return on investment (ROI) are expected to experience the highest demand.<br><br>While there is great enthusiasm among pump manufacturers to embrace IIoT in their products, they need to cherry-pick the technologies to reap the benefits. There is a glut of technologies in the market, as barriers to entry are low in IIoT, which has opened the door for technology startups and automation solution providers to challenge industry leaders. Meanwhile, pump manufacturers across the board will enjoy significant growth opportunities created by:
	</p>
	<p><strong>1. Rising oil & gas prices: </strong>With oil and gas being the largest end user of pumps, the increased oil production will drive demand for a variety of pumps. The pumps market in the oil & gas industry generated total revenue of $8,014.8 million in 2017.</p>
	<p><strong>2. The refining sector attracting investments in Asia-Pacific (APAC), the Middle East, and North America: </strong>WAsia will account for the largest investments with China and India being key countries driving new projects and greenfield investments. The Middle East is the next-largest region and will account for almost a quarter of the total global spending by the end of 2024.</p>
	<p><strong>3. Maintaining aging asset infrastructure and promoting asset health: </strong>Predictive analytics and smart maintenance will revolutionize the way pumps are operated, and compressors manufacturers need to develop capabilities to provide value-added services.</p>
	<p><strong>4. Midstream investments in pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG):</strong>Companies are expected to invest in the transportation infrastructure, such as oil pipelines, and this is expected to boost the market for large engineered pumps.</p>
	<p>&#34Although pump manufacturers are aware of the relevance of IIoT and predictive analysis to their business, many still prefer to adopt the wait-and-watch approach,&#34 noted Gnanamoorthy. &#34This is not the best strategy for this market because the first movers will have a huge advantage due to platformization, and the late adopters will be left fighting for an ever-shrinking share of the pie. It is vital to establish an analytics strategy in the next three years, as the typically long product development and launch cycles could make technology-shy companies quickly redundant.&#34</p>
