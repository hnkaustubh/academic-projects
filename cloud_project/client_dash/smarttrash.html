		<p>To make the cities greener, safer, and more efficient, Internet of Things (IoT) can play an important role. Improvement in safety and quality of life can be achieved by connecting devices, vehicles and infrastructure all around in a city. Best technological solutions can be achieved in smart cities by making different stakeholders to work together [5][6][7]. System integrators, network operators and technology providers have a role to play in working with governments to enable smart solutions. But, building such solutions on an open, standards-based communications platform that can be continuously used is a challenge. We present a waste collection management solution based on providing intelligence to wastebins, using an IoT prototype with sensors. It can read, collect, and transmit huge volume of data over the Internet. Such data, when put into a spatio-temporal context and processed by intelligent and optimized algorithms, can be used to dynamically manage waste collection mechanism. Simulations for several cases are carried out to investigate the benefits of such system over a traditional system. We try to replicate the scenario using Open Data from the city of Pune, India stressing on the opportunities created by this type of initiatives for several parties to innovate and contribute to the development of Smart waste management solutions.</p>
		<p>With each passing day, more cities globally have begun getting on board with the incorporation of smart waste management solutions into their systems. This is in a bid to create increased efficiency with regards to the costs and resources associated with ensuring that the cities are smart. Although only a few cities have begun testing the equipment of private households bins with advanced sensor technology, most of the cities have begun with the implementation of smart waste management solutions in the public sphere.At the moment, the state of technology used in smart waste management revolves around the use of sensors that measure how full a trash bin is. The measured data is in turn transferred to the Cloud where is it further processed and analyzed. Ordinarily, the explication of the data can aid the adequate planning of trash collection and track routes can be effectively optimized.</p>
		<p>The waste management solutions are geared towards making the environment healthier while also giving room for the optimization of the available utilities. In addition, smart waste management solutions also contribute to the total efficiency of waste recycling and also provide an opportunity for route optimization for the reduction in traffic and fuel consumption.A popular smart waste management solution includes having a sensor attached to trash bins to measure the fill level as well as a communication system that transmits the data to the Cloud. As the data processing is done in the cloud, the route of the collection trucks is in turn optimized. Thus, most companies dedicated to smart waste management have solutions that are based on what is referred to as ultrasonic distance measurement. Other companies will rather use an alternative solution that includes the use of camera and image processing as a passive sensor.The latter option is, however, more commonly used. The ultrasonic sensors also implement different types of sensors to obtain additional data. For instance, the sensors could be used for monitoring other parameters about the container’s status, such as the position through utilizing GPS or the use of motion sensors in a bid to register the container collections and also moved to detect likely vandalism.</p>

<p>Currently, most municipal waste collection operations focus on emptying containers according to predefined schedules at a set frequency. This system is inherently inefficient, with half-full bins being emptied, poor use of city assets, and unnecessary fuel consumption. Smart solutions—for tracking waste levels, route optimization, and operational analytics—offer municipalities and waste service managers the ability to optimize waste management services, reduce operational costs, and better address the environmental issues associated with inefficient waste collection. According to Navigant Research, the global smart waste collection technology market is expected to grow from $57.6 million in 2016 to over $223.6 million in 2025.This Navigant Research report examines the global market for smart waste collection technologies, with a focus on innovations happening in the first key element of the municipal solid waste management value chain: waste collection. The study provides an analysis of the market drivers and barriers associated with smart waste collection technology. Global market revenue and smart bin deployment forecasts, segmented by region, extend through 2025. The report also discusses urbanization trends and provides profiles of the key industry players within the smart waste collection market.</p>
<p>IoT-based Smart Waste Containers equipped with ultrasonic fill-level sensors and wireless connectivity for accurate reporting and optimisation.

Our Smart Waste Management System enables cities and businesses (like retailers, airports, building managers etc) to overcome the frequent challenges with waste collection and overflow issues.

Our Smart City Platform is designed to optimize the efficiency of waste collection. It provides a comprehensive collection of historical data and analytics reports empowering cities and businesses take better, data-driven decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Collect the Full Containers only</strong><br>Know exactly which containers are full and which are not. Never drive and pick-up empty containers again and reduce up to 50% of your waste collection costs.With our IoT based ultrasonic sensors you will be able to see the real situation of the waste containers in any area and plan your routes accordingly. In reality only about half of the containers really require collecting, while the other half are only half-full and might wait for the next collecting cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Plan the pick-up routes intelligently</strong><br>Based on the data received from the waste containers sensors, our cloud system will create smart collecting routes that you can send to the truck drivers every morning. Select the containers you wish to pick-up or let the system select them automatically for the most efficient and optimised routes.</p>
<p><strong>Smart fill-level sensors for any type of containers</strong><br>The smart sensors are monitoring the waste fill-level from each container and send it wirelessly to the cloud server.
Easy to install, the sensors are compatible with any type of containers and are capable of monitoring any substance or garbage type.</p>
<p><strong>User-friendly web-based visualisation</strong><br>The data collected from the sensor-equipped waste containers is processed and analysed by our cloud system. The data is then made available through the web-based platform.Select the containers to be collected or let the system automatically pick the high-priority ones and generate the most efficient and optimised collecting route for the garbage trucks.</p>
<p><strong>Increase efficiency and reduce costs with 50%</strong><br>Reduce collecting costs with up to 50% by driving on optimised routes only.

	<p>In essence, there are two major disadvantages of the solutions currently available. The first is that there is a non-uniform distribution of waste in the container and a simple distance measurement more often than not results in a false fill level measurement. The normal ultrasonic sensor commonly used have been proposed to be upgraded by several procedures but the results are generally still not the best. If for instance multiple sensors are used, that will help in getting a more precise determination of the fill level. However, it is quite costly and usually not the ideal solution for commercial purposes.</p>
	<p>Another disadvantage of the solution that exists is that it is incomplete and partial. A waste management cycle begins with the production of waste which is then disposed of at the local trash bins. Subsequently, a garbage collecting company collects the waste and brings it to the garbage depot where it is sorted and transferred for recycling, storage or destruction. However, a complete waste management solution should have something about trash bin fill level measurement, trucks’ route optimization and also involved in the recycling process by making the sorting process easier as the sorting process at the moment is manual and can be very slow. For the recycling process, the current smart waste management system that exists has no solution for the recycling process.</p>
	<p>However, even though the solution is an improvement on the sensorless solution as it is affected by major setbacks, the poor performance of sensors and also lack of contribution to the sorting done at the recycling plant are still some issues. However, a system that helps in the automated management of the lifecycle of products could lead to a simpler and cheaper recycling of used products. This occurs when the technical information about a particular product has been incorporated during production. Such information including the materials from which the product is gotten, the appropriate recycling ways, among other things. This would help organizations in charge of waste collection to automatically search for containers’ contents and to also organize the collection service according to the information gotten. In addition, that would make the waste management activities more cost-effective.</p>
